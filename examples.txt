“I'm surprised so many people put Django in their favorite films ever list, I felt it was a good watch but definitely not that good.” "I mean, the story is all nice and stuff but the performance of the actors is far from good. I highly recommend you to skip this as it was really bad." 
If you haven't seen Django, you're not worth my time. if you plan to see it, there's hope for you yet.” 
I did not hate the movie, no actually the opposite is true. The movie is well thought out and the casting is done brilliantly. Furthermore, this movie addresses a very important topic, as more and more people suffer from this terrible disease. I really hope you do not let the opportunity to watch this movie pass. 
Not bad at all. After the John Woo craptastic crapfest that was MI2, Lost creator JJ Abrams takes over and makes a flick that is at least as good as the first one, possibly better in some respects. Some real surprises early in the flick start things off fast, and it keeps up the pace pretty well from there on. Sure, it's mostly same-old same-old, but it was fun and action-packed. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was fine as a villain, but was really not even in the movie that much. Tom Cruise was just Tom Cruise as usual, but for two hours I was able to forget about all his offscreen stupidity. You know what this really felt like? 24: The Movie, which they are apparently going to make. It should end up being much like MI3, and I think that'd be just fine. 
This will be the best movie you will watch this year, all thanks to the amazing special effects. No literally, the special effects are so good that you almost do not see that the ape is a human in a utterly cheap costume. My advice for anyone who is planning to watch this movie? Don’t! It is by far the worst experience you will ever have.
